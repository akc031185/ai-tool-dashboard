# Step 8 - Admin Project Management + RFIs

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive admin project management capabilities with Request for Information (RFI) system to enable effective communication between admins and users.

## What Was Built

### Step 8A - Admin Problem List Endpoint
**File**: `pages/api/admin/problems.ts`

**Features**:
- Admin-only access with authentication
- Comprehensive filtering:
  - By kind (AI, Automation, Hybrid)
  - By domain (from triage data)
  - By status (draft, in-progress, complete)
  - By outline presence (yes/no)
- Aggregates unique domains for filter dropdown
- Populates user and assignee details
- Returns problems with all metadata

**Security**:
- Uses `requireAdmin` middleware
- Returns 403 for non-admin users

---

### Step 8B - Admin Console UI
**File**: `pages/admin/index.tsx`

**Features**:
- Responsive table with all problems
- Real-time filtering by kind, domain, status, outline
- Inline status changes via dropdown
- Assignee management (assign to admin users)
- Lock/unlock functionality to prevent user modifications
- RFI modal view showing all RFIs per problem
- Edit triage modal for correcting classification
- Visual status badges (color-coded)
- Problem details with truncation

**UI Components**:
- Filter bar with 4 dropdown filters
- Data table with sortable columns
- Toast notifications for actions
- Modal overlays for RFI viewing and triage editing

---

### Step 8C - Admin Triage Edit
**File**: `pages/api/admin/problems/[id]/triage.ts`

**Features**:
- PATCH endpoint to update triage classification
- Validates triage data structure
- Adds activity log entry with admin action
- Admin-only access

**Use Cases**:
- Correct AI/Automation/Hybrid classification
- Fix domain/subdomain assignments
- Update tags and metadata

---

### Step 8D - Status Management
**File**: `pages/api/admin/problems/[id]/status.ts`

**Features**:
- PATCH endpoint to change problem status
- Valid statuses: draft, submitted, in-progress, completed, cancelled
- Activity logging with old/new status
- Event logging for analytics (status.change)

**Workflow**:
1. User submits problem → "submitted"
2. Admin reviews → "in-progress"
3. Work completed → "completed"
4. If needed → "cancelled"

---

### Step 8E - Assignee Management
**File**: `pages/api/admin/problems/[id]/assign.ts`

**Features**:
- PATCH endpoint to assign/unassign problems
- Assigns to admin users only
- Activity logging
- Null assignment for "unassigned"

**Use Cases**:
- Workload distribution among admins
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Track who's working on what

---

### Step 8F - Lock/Unlock System
**File**: `pages/api/admin/problems/[id]/lock.ts`

**Features**:
- PATCH endpoint to toggle adminLocked flag
- When locked:
  - User cannot modify triage
  - User cannot regenerate outline
  - Admin can still edit everything
- Activity logging

**Use Cases**:
- Prevent accidental overwrites during admin work
- Freeze problem state during review
- Protect validated classifications

---

### Step 8G - RFI System (Request for Information)

#### Create RFI
**File**: `pages/api/problems/[id]/rfi/index.ts`

**Features**:
- POST endpoint to create new RFI
- Admin-only access
- Fields: question, priority (low/normal/high), dueDate
- Sends email notification to problem owner
- Activity logging
- Event logging (rfi.create)

#### Answer RFI
**File**: `pages/api/problems/[id]/rfi/[rfiId]/answer.ts`

**Features**:
- POST endpoint to answer RFI
- Accessible by problem owner or admin
- Updates RFI status to "answered"
- Records answeredAt timestamp
- Activity logging
- Event logging (rfi.answer)

#### Close RFI
**File**: `pages/api/problems/[id]/rfi/[rfiId]/close.ts`

**Features**:
- POST endpoint to close RFI
- Admin-only access
- Updates status to "closed"
- Activity logging
- Event logging (rfi.close)

---

## Data Models

### RFI Schema (embedded in Problem)
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  question: String,
  answer?: String,
  status: 'open' | 'answered' | 'closed',
  priority?: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high',
  dueDate?: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  answeredAt?: Date
}
```

### Activity Log Schema (embedded in Problem)
```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  at: Date,
  by: ObjectId (User),
  type: String,
  note: String,
  meta?: Object
}
```

## Business Value

### For Admins:
- **Centralized Dashboard**: View all problems in one place
- **Efficient Filtering**: Quickly find specific types of problems
- **Workload Management**: Assign and track problem ownership
- **Data Quality**: Edit incorrect triage classifications
- **Communication**: Request additional information from users
- **Protection**: Lock problems during critical work

### For Users:
- **Transparency**: See RFIs and their status
- **Responsiveness**: Answer questions to unblock progress
- **Notifications**: Email alerts for new RFIs
- **Activity History**: Track all admin actions on their problems

### For Business:
- **Scalability**: Support multiple admins handling workload
- **Quality Control**: Ensure accurate problem classification
- **Process Tracking**: Activity logs provide audit trail
- **Customer Service**: Clear communication channel
- **Analytics**: RFI metrics show common missing information

- `adminLocked` (Boolean, default false)
- `rfis` (Array of RFI subdocuments)
- `activity` (Array of Activity subdocuments)
